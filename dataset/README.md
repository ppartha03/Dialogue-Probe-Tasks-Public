# Preprocessing

We provide the preprocessed dataset in CSV. The preprocessing pipeline can be mimicked by running the following commands:
```
python WoZ_preprocess.py
python PersonaPreprocess.py
```
for generating the dataset for MultiWoZ and PersonaChat datasets respectively.

The datasets can be downloaded from their respective papers as cited in the paper (README.md at the root).
